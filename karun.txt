    I’ve added two files:

    • run_conversation.py – a CLI tool that reads a text file of utterances (lines “0: your text” or “1: your text”), lets you pick which prompt style
    (conversational_a or conversational_b) each speaker uses, and generates a single WAV.

    • sample_conversation.txt – a sample script you can pass to the tool.

    Usage example:

    bash
    python run_conversation.py sample_conversation.txt --style0 conversational_a --style1 conversational_b --output my_chat.wav

    Let me know if you’d like any tweaks!
